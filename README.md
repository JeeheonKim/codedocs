# Codedoc: Practice coding interview with peers

üòç Visit [codedoc.space](https://www.notion.so/codedoc.space) play around with it yourself! 

## Inspiration

Getting jobs especially as a technical role is really difficult in today's world. What's even harder is getting interviews and getting through them without any hassle. 

What's even harder is getting interviews and getting through them without any hassle. Both of us have attended multiple interviews and we noticed one of the major problems out there is the lack of coordination between the interviewers and the interviewees, especially on the technical rounds. There is not much interaction between the parties and does not end up being a good experience.

## What it does

Codedocs allows you to share code documents in real time with your interviewers to enhance the interactions in an interview and thereby having a better knowledge of the interviewees skillsets at the end of the day. CodeDocs provides the platform to allow you to have your own code editor on the go and helps you keep focus on the coding problems. It allows you to code in your own language of choice and helps you use your preferred themes. What's more, it allows live editing, so an interview experience is much more interactive, challenging and fun. CodeDocs also allows you to keep track of all your interview questions and solutions, all in one place so you can refer to them at any time and would help you stay a step ahead for your next interview. Having a live code editor, also means you can always have fun coding sessions with your friends and have an amazing experience at the same time.

CodeDocs basically stands out for the following features:

- Multi-language support and multi-theme support.
- Cloud storage for all your code interview questions so you can keep track of it at any time
- An inbuilt timer for allowing interviews to happen on time without hassle.
- Live editor allows an interactive experience between the interviewers and the interviewees so there's scope for more dynamic questions unlike other editors leading the platform currently.
- A more personalised interview experience.

## How We built it

We used ReactJS to build the frontend processing of the application. We used firebase auth to authenticate users while firestore as our main database to account for live editing and data storage. We deployed our application using firebase hosting.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were quite unsure of how live editing works and we are proud of accomplishing that task within a quick day. We also started late for the hack, so our end product for the hack is quite an accomplishment!

## What's next for CodeDocs:

The hack is more or less an incomplete one and did not live up to all the features we decided on to get it build with. We believe codeDocs is gonna be a huge success given that people from all over the world face this issue.Just some minor tweaks and we should be able to get this going on a quick pace!

1. **Data analytics on past interviews**: Basically run analytics on all the past interviews to predict lessons/questions that needs to be focused on ( eg: solving a linked list problem ) and things were you are weak during a coding interview so it can help you get better!
2. **Inline tutorials during coding**: We believe CodeDocs can also be used as a platform to teach coding to all the people out there. Enabling functionalities like recommending optimized steps to use while coding, autocomplete and embedding tutorials as side quests to make coding a lot more fun and are in our list of features to do.
and many more..
